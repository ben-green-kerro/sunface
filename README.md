# sunface
A big light for your face so you can wake up.

This project aims to provide a bright light to help stimulate wakefullness in the absence of natural light. Our bodies naturally wake when sunlight enters our eyes, even through closed eyelids. Through a WiFi connection, this light may be configured through Apple's HomeKit to smoothly turn on over the course of 30 minutes to reach full brightness at a specific time of desired waking.

White LEDs of a cool 6500k spectrum align with natural sunlight and is also similar in colour spectrum to LEDs used in lamps to treat seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Further to this, the lights brightness is flicker-free due to it the LEDs being powered by constant current driver ICs which is supposed to yield a marked improvement over pulse width modulation for eye-comfort.

A generic wall mount option is available, but the system may also be configured to be attached to a headboard by swapping out the 3D printed mounts at the ends of the light, although this will require some custom design work due to the differences in bed frames.
